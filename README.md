# MLOps - Robert Clements

This repository contains materials for the course, including notebooks, data, and models.

We will be doing labs and demos, we will be doing a lot of typical ML training processes, like adding data, writing model-training scripts, using Jupyter notebooks, and writing other pieces of code.
